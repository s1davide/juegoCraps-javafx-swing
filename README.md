<br />
The game begins with a throw called "Starting Shot" and has two phases: start and point. The exit refers to the first throw that is made to start the round and depending on the result the following happens:
<br />
• If the throw results in a 2, 3 or 12, this is known as "craps" and means that the player will automatically lose.
<br />
• If the roll results in a 7 or 11, this is known as a "natural" and the player wins.
<br />
• If the roll results in a 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10, this is known as a point and the player may continue to roll the dice in order to obtain the point value. If the point value is obtained before rolling a 7, then the round is considered successful and the player wins, otherwise the player loses.
